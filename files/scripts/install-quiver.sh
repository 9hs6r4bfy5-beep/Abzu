# installs this image used to ship:
#   * Daggerfall Unity             -> Interkarma/daggerfall-unity            (community catalog)
#   * Ship of Harkinian            -> HarbourMasters/Shipwright              (community catalog)
#   * 2 Ship 2 Harkinian           -> HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian         (community catalog)
#   * Super Mario Bros. Remastered -> JHDev2006/Super-Mario-Bros.-Remastered-Public (community catalog)
#   * SA Mod Manager               -> not covered; use Flatpak Hedge Mod Manager
# The games themselves are NOT baked into the image any more -- Quiver
# downloads and updates them per user, so the image stays slim.
#
# Deferred (Windows/macOS-only releases, no Linux build yet -- revisit when
# upstream ships one): elliotttate/DKC1Recomp, DKC2Recomp, DKC3Recomp.
# NOTE: Wave Race 64 IS seeded below -- the user picked DomazinUS/RaceWave46
# because it is the only WR64 recomp with ray-traced water (DXR via RT64).
# Its catalog entry (and elliotttate/wave-race-64-recomp's) are recorded in
# the community catalog should you want to subscribe instead.

# Seed the library with the entries that used to be installed standalone.
# Quiver keeps apps.json beside the AppImage, which is read-only on an
# immutable image, so it falls back to $XDG_DATA_HOME/QuiverLauncher (i.e.
# ~/.local/share/QuiverLauncher -- note the capitalisation: Services/
# QuiverLauncherPaths.cs uses AppName = "QuiverLauncher"). Drop a starter
# file there via /etc/skel; the quiver-setup justfile recipe copies it in
# place if the user wants it.
#
# Every entry below is copied VERBATIM from the live community catalog
# (tgeorgiadis/quiver-community-app-catalog, community-app-catalog/*.json).
# That matters for two reasons:
#   1. Quiver identifies library tiles by InstanceKey =
#      "{source}:{repository}:{folderName}" (Services/RepositorySourceHelper.cs)
#      and dedupes local apps against subscribed catalogs on that key
#      (AppCatalogService.DedupeByRepository). Any deviation in folderName
#      creates a duplicate tile instead of merging with the catalog row.
#   2. The parser reads exactly these camelCase fields: name, project,
#      repository, folderName, tags, appIconUrl (GetIconUrl also accepts
#      gameIconUrl/customDefaultIconUrl as legacy aliases). Unknown or
#      mis-cased keys are silently dropped, so hand-rolled schemas break.

# Heads-up on the Wave Race 64 seed: RaceWave46 is the WR64 static recomp with
# ray-traced water (DXR via RT64), which is why it was chosen over
# elliotttate/wave-race-64-recomp. Its releases are currently Windows-only and
# the game is BYO-ROM, so run it through Quiver's Wine/Proton wrapper until
# upstream ships a Linux host (see notes on N64ModernRuntime task_win32.cpp).

# Desktop entry.
# NOTE ON SELF-UPDATE: Quiver ships an in-app updater that rewrites the binary
# next to itself. On an immutable image /opt/quiver is not writable, so the
# updater will fail -- updates arrive by rebuilding this image instead. If you
# would rather have per-user self-updates, drop the AppImage into /etc/skel
# (~/.local/share/QuiverLauncher) and point Exec at that path.
